# Buffer Overflow Simulation

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a fixed-size memory buffer than it can hold. This extra data can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially causing the program to crash, behave unpredictably, or even execute arbitrary code.

### Attackers can exploit buffer overflows to:
- Execute malicious code on the system.
- Gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
- Crash or destabilize applications, leading to denial-of-service attacks.

## Features

- **Buffer Overflow Simulation** – Demonstrates how input exceeding a buffer can cause overflow.  
- **Command Injection Simulation** – Shows unsafe input handling in a controlled function (safe).  
- **Format String Vulnerability Simulation** – Illustrates the concept of unsafe string formatting.
